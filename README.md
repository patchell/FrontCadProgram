# FrontCadProgram
A simple CAD program for designing front panels

This is the source code for a program I call FrontCad.  It was written to allow users to create the artwork for front panels used in creating 
electronics projects.  It is a vector based cad program and it hass most of the features that any elementry cad program should have.

To compile this program, use Visual Studio 2015 Copmunity.
